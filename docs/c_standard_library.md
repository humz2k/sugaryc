# C Standard Library

WIP. Eventually, all C standard library functions/headers will have corresponding `sgh` equivalents. If something is missing, see `math.sgh` for examples on how to write your own wrappers. For any architecture dependent things, see `stdlib_macros.c` and `time_macros.c` in `cstdlib` for examples on how to deal with that. PRs welcome and would be appreciated!
